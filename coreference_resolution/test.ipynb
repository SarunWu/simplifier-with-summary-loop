The prestigious private school did n't identify the student , citing federal privacy laws . In a news release , it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review . The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday , the university said . Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved . Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well . Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting `` We are not afraid . We stand together , '' after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media . At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel , close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m. , hundreds of people gathered . `` You came here for the reason that you want to say with me , ` This is no Duke we will accept . This is no Duke we want . This is not the Duke we 're here to experience . And this is not the Duke we 're here to create , ' '' Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd . The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students . Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant . Two students were expelled . In February , a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi . A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus . In the news release , the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a `` cowardly act . '' `` To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act , I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear , it will have the opposite effect , '' Larry Moneta said Wednesday . Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham , North Carolina . CNN 's Dave Alsup contributed to this report .\""
